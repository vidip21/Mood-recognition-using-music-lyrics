Mood Recognition using Music Lyrics
This repository contains code and resources for mood recognition using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques applied to music lyrics. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can automatically classify the mood or emotional content of song lyrics. By analyzing the textual content of lyrics, we can gain insights into the emotional tone and sentiment expressed in songs.
